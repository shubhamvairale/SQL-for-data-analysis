Applications of SQL

As mentioned before, SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases. I'm going to list few of them here:

    Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.

    Allows users to describe the data.

    Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.

    Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.

    Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.

    Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.

    Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.
